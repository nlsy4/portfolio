<b>Audience Media Mapping for Global FMCG Brand</b> - Turned demographic data into a high-ROI media roadmap for a global FMCG leader

 <b>🌟The Challenge</b>
 
A world-renowned FMCG brand possessed deep psychographic and demographic data on their target segments but hit a "dead zone" in their execution: they didn't know where or when to spend their media budget. Without clear media consumption data, they risked high ad-spend wastage on channels their audience wasn't actually using.

<b>🔎The Action</b>

I bridged the gap between "who the audience is" and "where they live online" by:

1️⃣ Segment Recreation
Mapped existing brand personas into GWI (GlobalWebIndex) using complex attribute layering (demographics + lifestyle attitudes).

2️⃣ Media Consumption Deep-Dive
Analyzed 50+ touchpoints to identify high-affinity channels (Social, VOD, Podcasts, OOH) specifically for these segments.

3️⃣ "Day in the Life"
Crafted a chronological touchpoint map showing how segments engage with media from morning till night, identifying the "golden hours" for engagement.

4️⃣ Market Nuance Identification
Isolated key differences in media behavior across different markets to ensure the global strategy worked at a local level.

<b>🎯 The Results</b>

✅Provided a data-backed recommendation for budget reallocation, prioritising "high-attention" windows discovered in the "Day in the Life" analysis.

✅Delivered a comprehensive media playbook that the global marketing team used to brief their buying agencies.
